**Document 8: Project Plan / Roadmap (Initial)**

**Project:** ESP32 Scientific Programmable Networked Calculator (SPNC)
**Version:** 0.1
**Date:** 2023-10-27

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the planned phases and major milestones for the development of the SPNC project. Timelines are estimates and subject to change based on complexity and resources.

**2. Development Philosophy**

*   **Incremental Development:** Build core features first, then add complexity in layers.
*   **Modular Design:** Adhere to the defined software architecture for maintainability.
*   **Test-Driven (Aspirational):** Write unit/integration tests for critical components (sandbox, API, core math) where feasible. Manual system testing is essential throughout.
*   **Iterative UI/UX:** The initial UI and keymap are starting points; expect refinement based on testing and feedback.

**3. Phases & Milestones**

**Phase 1: Foundation & Core Calculator (Estimate: 2-4 Weeks)**

*   **M1.1: Hardware Bring-up:** Assemble prototype hardware. Verify basic ESP32 operation, display initialization (showing basic text), SD card mounting/reading/writing.
*   **M1.2: Basic I/O:** Implement `keyboard_manager` (basic scan, no modifiers yet) and `display_manager` (basic text drawing). Implement `config_manager` to load pin settings. `main.py` loop reads keys and echoes to display.
*   **M1.3: Core Math Engine:** Implement `math_engine` for basic arithmetic (+,-,*,/) using sandboxed `eval` or simple parser. Handle number input. Implement basic CALC mode UI layout.
*   **M1.4: SD Card Basics:** Implement `sd_manager` for basic file listing and reading/writing plain text. Implement history logging (simple append).
*   **M1.5: Configuration Loading:** Fully implement `config_manager` to load all hardware sections from `/sd/config.json`.
*   **Outcome:** A basic calculator capable of arithmetic, displaying input/output, reading the keyboard, and interacting minimally with the SD card.

**Phase 2: Scientific & UI Enhancement (Estimate: 3-5 Weeks)**

*   **M2.1: Scientific Functions:** Integrate `math` module functions into `math_engine`. Implement DEG/RAD/GRAD mode switching and display indicator.
*   **M2.2: Advanced Input/Display:** Handle parentheses, operator precedence correctly in `math_engine`. Implement multi-line display/scrolling in `display_manager`. Handle scientific notation input/output.
*   **M2.3: Variable Memory:** Implement STO/RCL logic and `variables` dictionary in `math_engine`.
*   **M2.4: Keymap Implementation:** Fully implement `keyboard_manager` including modifier keys (SHIFT/FN/ALPHA) based on `config.json` keymap. Refine keymap layout.
*   **M2.5: UI Layout Refinement:** Implement the multi-zone UI layout for CALC mode, potentially including variable watch pane. Improve status bar.
*   **Outcome:** A functional scientific calculator with variable memory and a more refined UI leveraging the 256x128 display.

**Phase 3: Scripting Engine & Sandbox (Estimate: 4-6 Weeks)**

*   **M3.1: Script Editor UI:** Implement `script_manager` UI for basic line editing (displaying script, editing current line).
*   **M3.2: Script File I/O:** Implement saving/loading `.py` files to `/sd/scripts/` via `script_manager` and `sd_manager`. Implement File Browser UI.
*   **M3.3: Sandbox Implementation:** **Critical.** Develop `sandbox_exec.py` with restricted builtins/globals. Implement safe `exec()`. Test rigorously.
*   **M3.4: Basic API:** Implement core `calculator_api.py` functions (variable access, display output, basic input, delay).
*   **M3.5: Script Execution:** Integrate sandbox execution into `script_manager` (RUN command). Implement basic error reporting (exceptions, line numbers) to the display.
*   **Outcome:** Users can write, save, load, and execute simple Micropython scripts that can manipulate variables and display output. Sandbox provides basic security.

**Phase 4: API & Networking (Estimate: 3-5 Weeks)**

*   **M4.1: WiFi Connection:** Implement `network_manager` for connecting to WiFi based on config. Display status icon.
*   **M4.2: HTTP API:** Implement `calculator_api.http_get/http_post` using `urequests`.
*   **M4.3: Wikipedia API:** Implement `calculator_api.wiki_search` including request formatting and JSON response parsing. Add API-WIKI mode UI.
*   **M4.4: LLM API:** Implement `calculator_api.llm_query` including request formatting, *secure* API key handling (loading from config, but warn user), JSON parsing. Add API-LLM mode UI.
*   **M4.5: Network Error Handling:** Improve robustness of network operations (timeouts, error reporting).
*   **Outcome:** Calculator can connect to WiFi and user scripts can interact with basic web APIs (HTTP, Wikipedia, LLM).

**Phase 5: I2C Integration (Estimate: 2-4 Weeks)**

*   **M5.1: I2C Hardware/Manager:** Implement `i2c_manager` to initialize and control the external I2C bus based on config.
*   **M5.2: I2C API:** Implement `calculator_api.i2c_scan/read/write` functions.
*   **M5.3: I2C Device Map:** Implement loading and usage of the optional I2C map for `calculator_api.i2c_read/write_reg`.
*   **M5.4: Testing:** Test thoroughly with known external I2C devices using scripts. Add I2C Monitor mode (optional).
*   **Outcome:** User scripts can communicate with external hardware via the I2C bus.

**Phase 6: Refinement & Documentation (Ongoing)**

*   **M6.1: Bug Fixing:** Address issues identified during testing.
*   **M6.2: Performance Optimization:** Profile code, optimize bottlenecks (display updates, script execution).
*   **M6.3: UI/UX Polish:** Refine layouts, fonts, key mappings based on usability testing.
*   **M6.4: Feature Completion:** Implement remaining 'nice-to-have' API functions or UI features from requirements.
*   **M6.5: Documentation:** Finalize User Manual, Developer Guide, and update all specification documents.
*   **M6.6: Release Preparation:** Create distributable code/firmware package, write release notes.
*   **Outcome:** A stable, well-documented version 1.0 release candidate.

**4. Dependencies & Risks**

*   **Hardware Availability:** Sourcing ESP32 w/PSRAM and specific 256x128 OLED.
*   **Micropython Driver Availability/Stability:** Ensuring stable drivers exist for chosen OLED and potentially PSRAM.
*   **Sandbox Security:** Implementing the execution sandbox correctly and securely is paramount and complex.
*   **UI/UX Complexity:** Designing an intuitive interface for coding and complex functions on a small device with a matrix keyboard is challenging.
*   **Memory Management:** Even with PSRAM, careful memory management in Micropython is required, especially with networking and large data structures.
*   **API Key Security:** Handling external API keys securely is a significant challenge.

**5. Tools**

*   IDE: Thonny, VS Code with Micropython extensions.
*   Version Control: Git (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
*   Serial Monitor: For debugging output.
*   File Transfer: Thonny, rshell, ampy.
*   Hardware Debugger: JTAG debugger (optional, advanced).
*   I2C Analyzer: Logic analyzer or dedicated I2C tool for debugging external bus.
