**Document 5: Testing Plan (Initial Draft)**

**Project:** ESP32 Scientific Programmable Networked Calculator (SPNC)
**Version:** 0.1
**Date:** 2023-10-27

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the initial testing strategy for the SPNC project to ensure functionality, reliability, and adherence to requirements.

**2. Testing Levels**

*   **Level 1: Unit Testing:** Testing individual software modules or functions in isolation.
*   **Level 2: Integration Testing:** Testing the interaction and data flow between different modules.
*   **Level 3: System Testing:** Testing the fully assembled hardware and software system against the functional and non-functional requirements.
*   **Level 4: User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Testing by potential end-users (if applicable) focusing on usability and real-world scenarios.

**3. Unit Testing Approach**

*   Focus on core logic modules where possible using Micropython's `unittest` or similar framework, potentially running tests on a host machine or the ESP32 itself.
*   **Key Modules for Unit Tests:**
    *   `math_engine`: Test evaluation of various expressions, operator precedence, function accuracy (vs standard library), DEG/RAD/GRAD conversions, variable storage/retrieval.
    *   `sandbox_exec`: **Critical.** Test sandbox restrictions (preventing forbidden builtins/imports), correct injection of `calculator_api`, exception handling and reporting. Test execution of simple valid/invalid scripts.
    *   `config_manager`: Test loading valid/invalid/missing config files, default value handling.
    *   Utility functions within managers (e.g., data parsing/formatting).

**4. Integration Testing Approach**

*   Test interactions between modules, often requiring running code on the actual ESP32 hardware.
*   **Key Integration Scenarios:**
    *   `calculator_api` <-> Backend Managers: Write scripts that call every function in `calculator_api` and verify the expected interaction with `display_manager`, `sd_manager`, `network_manager`, `i2c_manager`, `math_engine`.
    *   `main.py` <-> Mode Managers: Test transitions between modes, passing of control, and UI updates.
    *   Keyboard Input -> `main.py` Dispatch -> Module Action -> Display Update.
    *   SD Card Operations: Test saving/loading scripts, data, history, logs via the relevant managers/API calls. Verify file contents.
    *   Network Operations: Test WiFi connection, making HTTP GET/POST calls via `calculator_api`, handling responses and errors. Requires network access.
    *   I2C Operations: Connect known test I2C devices (e.g., another ESP32, EEPROM, sensor) and test `calculator_api.i2c_...` functions. Test scan, read, write, register access, error handling (NACK).

**5. System / Manual Testing Approach**

*   Execute end-to-end scenarios on the fully assembled calculator.
*   Use checklists based directly on the Functional Requirements (FR-*).
*   **Key Test Areas:**
    *   **Core Calculation:** Enter complex scientific calculations, verify results against known good calculator/tool. Test all functions, modes, variable usage.
    *   **Scripting:** Create scripts covering all `calculator_api` functions. Edit, save, load, run scripts. Test error reporting for script syntax/runtime errors. Test sandbox limitations.
    *   **UI/UX:** Verify all UI layouts match design. Test navigation flow, responsiveness, readability, status bar indicators.
    *   **SD Card:** Verify history logging, system logging (check file contents). Test file browser functionality. Test data saving/loading from scripts. Test behavior with SD card full/removed (if applicable).
    *   **Networking:** Test WiFi setup, API calls (Wikipedia, LLM), handling of network down/API errors.
    *   **I2C:** Connect sample I2C sensors/devices, write scripts to interact with them, verify data exchange, test I2C error handling.
    *   **Stress Testing:** Leave scripts running complex loops or network requests, perform rapid key presses, check for crashes or freezes. Test with large files/long history.
    *   **Configuration:** Test changing settings in `/sd/config.json` (Pins, Keys, WiFi, etc.) and verify behavior after reboot.

**6. Test Environment**

*   **Primary:** Actual SPNC hardware prototype.
*   **Secondary:** Host machine execution for pure-Python unit tests where possible.
*   **Network Access:** WiFi network with internet connectivity, potentially local HTTP/LLM test servers.
*   **I2C Test Devices:** Known-good I2C peripherals (e.g., temperature sensor, RTC, EEPROM).
